* Splitscreen/Multiple Windows
  | Function                                              | Shortcut |

* File (Buffer) Handling
  Buffer is the emacs jargon for an opened file or temporary text window (e.g.
  message buffer that contains error messages) . A file that's opened doesn't
  necessarily also have to be visible. You can have as many opened (and maybe
  also partially edited files) as you want and only show a subset of them on the
  screen within one or several (splitscreen) windows.

  |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------|
  | *Switch to another buffer* (in Spacemacs this show a nice list of all opened buffers | ~C-x b~  |
  | *Close (kill) the buffer/file* (will ask if you want to safe if it was modified)     | ~C-x k~  |

* Searching/Replacing (Spacemacs specific)
  | Function                             | Shortcut  |
  |--------------------------------------+-----------|
  | *Search in current file (buffer)*    | ~M-m s s~ |
